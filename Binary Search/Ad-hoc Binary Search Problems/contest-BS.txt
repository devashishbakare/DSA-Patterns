we have to find out the longest length where next element is square of prev
Note : In question they have said, about subsequence, but contrains is 10^5,
so we should think about, sort and then binary search 
code :
public int longestSquareStreak(int[] nums) {
        int size = nums.length;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int ans = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){
            int val = nums[i];
            int count = 1;
            while(true){
                if(Arrays.binarySearch(nums, val*val) >= 0){
                    val = val * val;
                    count++;
                }else break;
            }
             
            ans = Math.max(ans, count);
                
        }
        if(ans != 1) return ans;
        return -1;
        
    }
