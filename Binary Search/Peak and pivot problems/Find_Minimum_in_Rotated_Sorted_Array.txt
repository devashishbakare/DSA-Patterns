problem : https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/

Important learning -> 
In which direction should I go if array is sorted but rotating, how you can figure out we should go to left direction or rigth direction on the basis of mid element

code :

class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
 
        int n = nums.length;
        int low = 0;
        int high = n-1;
        
        while(low < high){
            
            //if first element is smaller than the last element then array is not rotated
            if(nums[low] < nums[high]) return nums[low];
            
            int mid = low + (high - low)/2;
            
            //if my middle element is greater than then low then rigth side have the maximum element and next of maximum element is min
            if(nums[mid] >= nums[low]){
                low = mid +1;
            }else{
              high = mid;              
            } 
            
        }
    
        return nums[low];
        
    }
}
