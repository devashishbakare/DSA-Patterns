-Given starting and ending positions interval in line.
-the task is to take the union of all given interval and find length covered by these interval.

Interval[] = {{2, 5}, {4, 8}, {9, 12}}

2-5-4-8 -> overlap so -> 2-8 are streight line.
interval become :
{2, 8}, {9,12}
total distance = 9(6+3)
6 = 8-2
3 = 12-9


Algorithm:

- consider every element as indivisually start interval : false, end : true
- sort in ascending order
- take result if count > 0 : result ? arr[i]-arr[i-1];
- decrement the count if found the ending point(true)
- increment the count if found the starting point(false)
