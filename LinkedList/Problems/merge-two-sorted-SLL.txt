code : you can use extra space, but inplace also good option
Note : understand the edge case

public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode first, ListNode sec) {
        
        ListNode res = null;
        ListNode temp = null;
        
        //edge case
        if( first == null)
            return sec;
        if( sec == null)
            return first;
        
        //keeping first as minimum, coz we are merging in first  
        if( first.val > sec.val)
        {
            temp = first;
            first = sec;
            sec = temp;
        }
       
        res = first;
        ListNode pointer = null;   
        while( first != null && sec != null )
        {
             pointer = null;
            // move toward right until first val is lesser
            while( first != null && first.val <= sec.val)
            {
                pointer = first;
                first = first.next;
            }
            pointer.next = sec;
            
            ListNode swap = first; 
            first = sec;    
            sec = swap;
        }
        return res;
    
        
    }
